# 🍽️ FoodieSync: Smart Surplus Food Redistribution Platform

**FoodieSync** is an AI-powered platform that reduces food wastage and fights hunger by connecting restaurants, NGOs, and communities. It uses smart prediction and facility management tools to ensure surplus food is safely redistributed — and also makes surplus food available for affordable ordering by users.
